# Introduction

**Webpack - Fend Capstone Travel App Project - Summary**
<br /> This project has been duplicated from Project3(WeatherApp) and is configured using webpack to bundle resources for the Front End. The Capstone Travel APP Back End integrates with three Api's(GEONAME location of country, WEATHERBIT.IO weatherdata, and PIXABAY images). The server endpoint takes these inputs and tells the departing location informayion to the user. This information is then displayed to the user in a chart which eventuate the time, country, city, image and weather of the next location.

<br /> To extend my project further, I've decided to implement the second option, as an arrangement for this specific project.

- Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities)
